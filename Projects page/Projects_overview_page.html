          <p>Design and Creativity course was focused on creating a portfolio that is a collection of sketches.

          <p>Research for Design (part II) is specifically oriented on Ethnographic research.
            Ethnography in design involves a lot of naturalistic observation, interviewing and exploring.
            It also studies behavioural patterns and based on those it inspires design. </p>

          <p>In the Skills Lab course we have been working on creating the visuals of a website related to the Hague.
            The topic was a free choice and I have decided to design a website that is meant for tourists.
            It contains sections as advise where to go, what is worth trying and where to meet locals. </p>

          <p>In the introduction to UX course we have been learning what are the user experience factors of any product.</p>
            <p>There are several cathegories that influence the exprience of user: Usability, Engagement & Meaning.
             One of the final works was a poster with evaluation of an app of our choice based on criteria learned throughout the course.  </p>
